# BlackWhiteAPManual
## About
A Manual Randomizer for use with Pokémon Black and White, for use with the [Archipelago Manual](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago) Project. This Manual randomizes all ground items, HMs, Badges, and items given by important characters. Options are included to add hidden items as well as items from all the other NPCs.

This AP World assumes you know how to add items to your game using [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) (brief tutorial is included below)
