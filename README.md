# Pokémon Black and White AP Manual
## About
A Manual Randomizer for use with Pokémon Black and White, for use with the [Archipelago Manual](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago) Project. This Manual randomizes all ground items, HMs, Badges, and items given by important characters. Options are included to add hidden items as well as items from all the other NPCs.

This AP World assumes you know how to add items to your game using [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) (brief tutorial is included below)

Shoutouts to Linneus and their [Pokémon Platinum Manual](https://github.com/Linneus/PlatinumAPManual/releases/tag/2.3) without out which I would not have been inspired to make this Manual or have the knowledge to add extra options.

## Check Rewards
- HMs
- TMs
- Badges
- Key Items
- Item from the "Items Pocket"
- Medicine Items

## Logic Requirements
*These are the items you are expected to receive from the server in order to progress past certain points*
 - HM01 Cut to get past the tree in the Dreamyard and then proceed to Route 3 as well as checks behind other Cut trees
 - Insect Badge to access the area of Route 4 North of the Cheren fight
 - Bolt Badge to access Driftveil City
 - Light/Dark Stone to initiate the Bianca fight and proceed to Tubeline Bridge
 - HM03 Surf to get any checks that require you to Surf
 - HM04 Strength to get checks behind Strength rocks
 - HM05 Waterfall to checks up Waterfalls (Currently only one check)
 - TM70 Flash to get checks in dark caves
 - Completing the "Recieve Bicycle" Event check to access eastern Pinwheel forest
 - All eight Badges to access Victory Road, the Pokémon League, and N's Castle

## Check Locations
### Always Available
- Items given by "important" NPCs
- Item balls you find on the ground
- HMs
- Badges
- Various events you complete throughout the game. (They will always give you the event as an item) These are just to help know what you gain access to upon completing the tasks.
### Available with options
- Hidden Items
- Items given by all other NPCs
- Mistralton Cave items

## Current Available Options
### Two Goal Options
- Defeat Ghetsis at N's Castle - The default goal where you collect eight Badges receive the game's credits (Longer goal ideal for Asyncs)
- Defeat Cobalion at Mistralton Cave - A shorter goal that excludes all checks from Twist Mountain and beyond, where you collect four Badges and take down the Sword of Justice (Ideal for Syncs)
### Other Options
- Include NPC Items - Adds checks from all random NPCs that give items
- Randomize Hidden Items - Adds checks for the hidden items found throughout the game
- Require Dowsing MCHN - Makes it so you need to receive the Dowsing MCHN before you are logically required to pick up hidden items
- Include Mistralton Cave Items - Adds Mistralton Cave checks to the pool. This option was added to improve the Cobalion goal by preventing you from having to go through the cave twice if this is set to "false"
